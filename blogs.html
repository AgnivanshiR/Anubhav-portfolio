                <h1>A Decade at IBM and a New Journey as a Full Stack Developer</h1>
                <div id="blog-content">
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                    <p>My name is Rahul and I have been working as an Application Developer with IBM for almost a decade. While I have enjoyed my time with the company and learned a lot, I have always felt a desire to take on more challenging projects and expand my skillset.</p>
                    <p>That's why I have recently decided to make a career change and learn full stack development. I have always been interested in the full spectrum of web development, from the front-end user interface to the back-end server-side logic, and I feel that becoming a full stack developer will allow me to take on more diverse and exciting projects.</p>
                    <p>I have left my job at IBM and have started learning full stack development through the online platform neoGCamp. I have completed the Mark 9 assignment of Level 0 and am excited to continue my journey through the program.</p>
                    <p>It is not an easy decision to leave a job that you have been with for a long time, especially in the current climate. But I am confident that this change will be the best decision for my career and personal growth. I am excited to learn new technologies and take on new challenges as a full stack developer.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for reading, and I hope to share more updates on my journey as a full stack developer in the future.</p>
                    <p>Best regards,<br>Rahul</p>
